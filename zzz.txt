
next i want you yourself to first give me a py simulation fo something before i go to copilot about it.

it's the new markets for everythign related to moneylines and want notits for monte carlos

given some n players' as input each player's name, mean and stddev, we need to simualte the following game:
those means are roundwise means, not fucking gamewise means so they're fore ach of the five rounds.
each game has 5 rounds of the following:
sim all players, sample frmo normal with their means and std devs

then at the end of the 5 rounds, keep tab of who won and return everyone's totals too.

and then this is for a single game/iteration

we will write a simulation that does this maybe for 10000 iterations
ok understand?
if you did, write a py script that takes in inputs as those n players object with those 3 things per playerand sims this
just write that py func
i want to test it as an isolated py script. show this script for me
and then try it with this sample input and trying
name: Pam, mean: 2600, std dev: 1000
name: Sohan, mean: 3100, std dev: 750
name: Pritesh, mean: 3000, std dev: 1000
name: Naresh, mean: 2200, std dev: 1500


another very important thing is that the max for all of these is actually 5000. anytime the number sampled exceeds 5k guardrail by picking unifmromly from range (4950, 5000) this is cirticla

code it up now the py wscript and print clearly on py terminal wheni run it so i can all stats

#######
market pricing for SPECIALS
it has to create a specials_pricing.py file in the relevant folder and borrow the utils funcs like conversions, vig adding and all coz there's gonna be lot of speicfic pricing in here particulr to some people and groups

No Europe and Oceania > 1.5:
for this can be priced via simulation only. ask it to make a func called europelessoceania() where it just smis. given each continent's probabilities:
for example, (JUST EXAMPLE): europe: 0.55, asia: 0.1, africa: 0.15, south america: 0.14, north america: 0.03, oceania: 0.03

then with htese probs wrighted, it will run a 5 round version:
for each round sample from those weights

in the end mark this ITERATION as true if no europe and oceania > 1.5
if not mark as falase

in the end it needs to find how many were true divided by iterations to get true prob.

then we'll apply vig and give the market out there ok then ready let's go then come on now

next market is:

3 Europe, 1 Asia, 1 Africa:
again exact same idea where it sims the 5 round game and counts as true when there are 3 europes, 1 asia and 1 africa in any order

next ask it to write the sim and probs and vig addition and pricing for the "Naresh First Guess > 3000" and "Naresh Last Guess > 3000"

this jsut needs to use the OG ml simulator skeleton and count the times naresh gets > 3000 on both those. or it can just literally use math, coz we know mean and std dev. ask it to find his stats, or his playerid, by checking the name column in geo_players
and then once it finds the times he had more than 3000 on both those rounds in a game, it can divide by trials, get prob apply vig the wwhole shaboom

next market: 
No World Cup Winners:
the world cup winners are: {Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil}
ask it to find all these countries in geo_countries via the column name country and then find the freq
ask it to sum all those freqs up.
this is the probability of one of these coming on any given round
we need (1-p)^5 for probability that worldcupteams never appears in a game and we apply 7 percent vig and present it to frontend and everything as usual

next SPECIALS is:
France and Germany Both to appears
can be done with math or simulation either way is fine here for this

moving on:


############### REVIGGING #################################################################

Found a new method to ensure the new vig guardrails are never important when the impleud prob goes  over 1

the issue earlier was let's say there was a prob = 0.98 of some outcome occuring, so when applying like a 5 percent margin it gord up to 1.029 and suddenyl can't convert back to amrerican anymore
the solution is to do the following, to apply the vig to the decimal form version of the odds, then convert that to prob and/or amercian. using following formula

so lets say fair decimal rice is d and say the margin is m such as m = 0.05
then v (the vigged priced) is o / (1 + m). simple as fuck. so if fair prob was 40 percent, the fair decimal is 2.5. for five percent vig we do 2.5 / (1+0.05) = 2.5/1.05 = 2.38 and on the other side it'll be 60 percent initial which was -150 whih is 1.6666 so it's 1.66666/1.05 = 1.587
so vigged line there would be 2.38 and 1.587 which we would then convert to american and so forth. capisce?



IMPORTANT:
- Do not introduce any TypeScript errors or type mismatches. The code must compile cleanly.
- Do not touch any other markets, payload logic, or unrelated code. Scope this change strictly to the new Help page.
- Keep styling, formatting, and layout consistent with the global ecosystem (same tab styling, same left bar navigation).

Task:
Add a new Help page to the app. Place it on the left navigation bar, below all odds screens. Clicking "Help" should redirect to this new page.

Structure:
The Help page has two tabs: **Basic** and **Terms**.

Tab 1: BASIC
Content (in professional English):
- All users must have betGSIS accounts to place bets on the platform.
- Currently only the GeoGuessr Odds Screen is active, with the rest of the platform under development.
- Users can select any offered market except those designated as ILLEGAL (see Terms tab), choose stake size, and place wagers.
- All bets can be viewed under "My Bets" or Profile → Bet Logger.
- Active bets can be settled and viewed on the "Bet Settler" page.
- Bets must be settled with integrity at the conclusion of each game, as the global GeoGuessr game counter is incremented. This counter is used to identify each game and its associated bets.
- Statistics such as PnL, bet history, and edge can be viewed on the Portfolio page.
- Kottayam prices will be released soon.

Tab 2: TERMS
Sections and content:

**ANTE**
- An Ante must always be placed on each game. This is non‑negotiable.
- Please note that Antes are the only vig‑free market offered.

**ILLEGAL BETS**
- You may never bet your own unders.
- You may never bet anyone’s Moneyline except your own, unless it is a game you are not participating in and the lines have been repriced accordingly.
- You may never bet on another player’s Specials that require strong performance (i.e., you cannot wager on someone doing exceptionally well, since you could intentionally play poorly to distort their odds).
- Parlays are not currently supported.
- You may not place bets for any game other than the current global game counter shown on the navigation bar.

**COUNTRIES AND CONTINENTS**
- All of Russia and all of Turkey count as Europe.
- European overseas colonies that are non‑sovereign count as their European parent nation and Europe as a continent. Examples include: British Virgin Islands (UK), Curaçao (Netherlands), Bermuda (UK), Martinique (France). This list is not exhaustive.
- The Island of Jersey counts as the UK.
- Monaco does not count as France, as it is a sovereign city‑state.
- The Faroe Islands and Greenland both being part of the Kingdom of Denmark will count as Denmark and Europe.
- All US overseas territories and minor outlying islands count as the US and North America.
- All Caribbean islands count as North America except European overseas colonies.
- Antarctica loses on all continents.

**LOCKING**
- Any market or specific bet may be locked at any time at the discretion of betGSIS traders.

Acceptance criteria:
- A new Help section appears in the left navigation bar, below odds screens.
- Clicking Help opens the Help page with two tabs: Basic and Terms.
- Content is displayed exactly as above, in professional English.
- Styling and formatting match global tab/page consistency.
- No TypeScript errors or warnings introduced.
- No unrelated code is modified.



i want to insert 4 more rows into the country table, but in a way that the countryid serially matches with dewscending order of freq
currently it's like that so if i simply insert, it's merely gonna append to the end which is undesribal

right now last 3 rows are like kyrgyzstan: 0.34, mongolia, 0.34 and cambodia 0.34
but i want to add like United States: 2.1 and i want to go in the right placeso find a smart sql script,t aht can keep everything as is now and insert these in the right place:

United States: 2.1
China: 0.44
